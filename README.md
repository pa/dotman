# dotman - dot(files) man(ager)

dotman is a [go](https://go.dev/) based simple and light weight tool for managing [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory). This tool uses a [bare Git repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) that means your `$HOME` will be your git work tree. Also it offers a plugin manager with rules to copy files from source git repo and even directory which most of the tools out there won't support.

I named this tool after I got inspired by [Bhupesh's](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V) project [dotman](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/dotman)
